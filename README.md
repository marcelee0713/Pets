This is where I put everything I learned from The Odin Project.
I would probably still edit or modify this repository from time to time, probably...
It is similar with the assignment about "odin-recipes".
But instead I used my favorite pets.
You can also see my odin-recipes, I wouldn't bother modifying it.
Anyways, why are you even reading this?
