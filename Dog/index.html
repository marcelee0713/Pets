            <p>Of course my number one is the <strong>Dog</strong> because they are the man's best friend.
                <br> They can also be our guard and family dog. Usually dogs are <em>friendly, playful, and energetic.</em></p>
                <p>They can easily be tamed, some are <em>hard</em> though.</p>
